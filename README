nn (neural network) is a C implementation of a multi-layer perceptron, also known as a neural network.  
All options are specified in the nn.config file.
The number of layers, and number of nodes in each layer is arbitrary, determined in the variable STATE_SIZE_LIST of nn.config.
Activation functions from input to hidden layers and to output layers are all via a sigmoidal function, so nn is suitable as a classifier but not predictor without more changes to the output function.

Training (Learning) occurs via minimization of a least-squared error (the objective function) using gradient descent.  This does not guarantee convergence to global minima, and furthermore is an inefficient search method compared to Levenberg-Marquardt.

Installation instructions:

The latest version of this software is located in the github repository: https://github.com/wwchen256/c-multilayer-perceptron

To install, clone the remote repository to your local machine and type 'make' in the local repository directory.
The binary should be installed in the root of the local repository.

To run, inspect the nn.config file to see which data set is being used to train the neural network.  Adjust parameters accordingly.  The binary is named 'nn' (neural network) so enter './nn' at the command line.

Compilation requires gcc and math libraries.
